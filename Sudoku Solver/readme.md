## Introduction
Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle. This project demonstrates how to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow to solve Sudoku puzzles by recognizing and filling in the missing numbers.

## Project Overview
This project aims to solve Sudoku puzzles using three different deep learning algorithms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Each algorithm is implemented to demonstrate its effectiveness in solving Sudoku puzzles.
