# Dog Face Detection Models

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for detecting dog faces using deep learning models. One notebook implements YOLOv8 and MobileNet SSD, while the other notebook implements VGG16.

## Notebooks

### 1. YOLOv8 and MobileNet SSD Notebook
- This notebook implements YOLOv8 and MobileNet SSD for dog face detection.
- File: `dog-face-detection1.ipynb`
- Description: The notebook provides an implementation of YOLOv8 and MobileNet SSD models using deep learning techniques to detect dog faces in images.

### 2. VGG16 Notebook
- This notebook implements VGG16 for dog face detection.
- File: `dog-face-detection2.ipynb`
- Description: The notebook contains an implementation of the VGG16 model using deep learning techniques to detect dog faces in images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Ultralytics
