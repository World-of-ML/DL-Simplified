Wheat is the main ingredient of most common food products in our daily lives and obtaining good quality wheat kernels is an important matter for the production of food supplies. In this study, durum wheat kernels which have vast harvest areas in Turkey and is the principal ingredient of pasta and semolina products were examined and classified to obtain top quality wheat kernels based on their vitreousness. Also, top quality provision of food supplies means that the products must be refined from all foreign materials so a classification process has been applied to extract foreign materials from wheat kernels.
