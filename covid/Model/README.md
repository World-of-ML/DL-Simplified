COVID - 19 VACCINE TRACKER

GOAL: TO TRACE ALL THE VACCINE SHOTS GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE AND COVID'S 
AFFECT ON THE WORLD.

DATASET: COVID WEBSITE AND 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report

DEXCRIPTION: THE DATASET WAS IN FORM OF A CSV FILE CONTAINING ALL THE 
INFORMATIONS ABOUT COVID VACCINATION.

WHAT I HAD DONE: 
FIRSTLY, IMPORTED THE CSV FILE AND FILTERED IT USING EXCEL SHEET. THEN 
I IMPORTED THE CSV FILE TO TABLEAU SOFTWARE. WHERE I CREATED AN 
INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD. 

I DEVELOPED A DASHBOARD WHERE WE CAN MODIFY AND CHANGE THE FIELDS TO SEE 
THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTTRY'S INFORMATION. ALSO ADDED A BAR GRAPH AND 
GEOSPATIAL MAPS AND A GRAPH SHOWING ALL COUNTRY'S GDP AFFECTION DUE TO THE 
VIRUS. 

MODELS USED: 
1. BAR GRAPHS
2. LINE GRAPHS
3. GEOSPATIAL MAPS

SOFTWARE USED:
1. TABLEAU 

CONCLUSION: I WAS SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO DEVELOP A TABLEAU DASHBOARD FOR 
COVID - 19 VACCINE TRACKER.
