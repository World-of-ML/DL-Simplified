# Laptop Price Prediction

This project aims to predict laptop prices using machine kearning and deep learning models. The dataset used in this project contains various features of laptop, including both categorical and numerical variables. It uses different ML and DL models for the task, then chooses the best model based on the accuracy scores.

## üßµ **Dataset DESCRIPTION**

There are 11 features and 1304 entries in this dataset. The different features available in this dataset are :-

- **`Company`** - The Company which makes this Laptop
- **`TypeName`** - The type of laptop, e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook, Gaming, etc.
- **`Inches`** - The size/width of the laptop in inches.
- **`ScreenResolution`** - The type of screen of the laptop, e.g., IPS, HD, FHD, etc, whether it is touchscreen or not, and the resolution of the screen in pixels.
- **`Cpu`** - Corresponds to the type of processor present in the laptop.
- **`Ram`** - COrresponds to the size of the RAM in the laptop.
- **`Memory`** - Corresponds to the type and size of the memory present in the laptop.
- **`Gpu`** - Corresponds to the brand and type of GPU present in the laptop.
- **`OpSys`** - The type of operating system present in the laptop, e.g., Windows, MacOS, Linux, etc.
- **`Weight`** - The weight of the laptop in kgs.

## üßÆ **WHAT I HAVE DONE**

* First I imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project.
* Performed some EDA on the whole dataset.
* Removing the units from RAM and Weight column.
* Analysing each and every column individually and preparing visualization about its impact on the target variable.
* Removing the unnecessary variables.
* Performing one hot encoding on object features and converting them into integer datatype.
* Visualizing the dataset distribution in univariate and bivariate with target feature.
* Watching the correlation of different features by plotting Heatmap.
* Keep the necessary features for further processing and splitting the dataset into training and testing set.
* Then, i have developed multiple machine learning models and calculated their error and score.
* Then, i have developed ANN and RNN deep learning models and predicted their score which is better than the machine learning algorithms and fit the dataset properly.
* Finally plotting the graph of visualizing how the model is reducing the mean absolute error with every epoch.
