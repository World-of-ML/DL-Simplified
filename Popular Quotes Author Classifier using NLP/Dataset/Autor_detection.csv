"My conception of a novel is that it ought to be a personal struggle a direct and total engagement with the authors story of his or her own life This conception again I take from Kafka who although he was never transformed into an insect and although he never had a piece of food an apple from his familys table lodged in his flesh and rotting there devoted his whole life as a writer to describing his personal struggle with his family with women with moral law with his Jewish heritage with his Unconscious with his sense of guilt and with the modern world Kafkas work which grows out of the nighttime dreamworld in Kafkas brain is more autobiographical than any realistic retelling of his daytime experiences at the office or with his family or with a prostitute could have been What is fiction after all if not a kind of purposeful dreaming The writer works to create a dream that is vivid and has meaning so that the reader can then vividly dream it and experience meaning And work like Kafkas which seems to proceed directly from dream is therefore an exceptionally pure form of autobiography Theres an important paradox here that I would like to stress the greater the autobiographical content of a fiction writers work the smaller its superficial resemblance to the writers actual life The deeper the writer digs for meaning the more the random particulars of the writers life become impediments to deliberate dreaming
