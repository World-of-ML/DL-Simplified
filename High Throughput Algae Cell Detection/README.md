# 🌿 High Throughput Algae Cell Detection 🔍

## 🚀 Project Overview

**📌 Project Title**: High Throughput Algae Cell Detection

**🎯 Aim**: The aim of this project is to detect high throughput algae cells using Deep Learning and OpenCV methods.

**📊 Dataset**: [High Throughput Algae Cell Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/high-throughput-algae-cell-detection)

## 🛠 Approach

I'm planning to explore the following models for the project:

1. [Xception](https://keras.io/api/applications/xception) 🧠
2. [ConvNeXtTiny](https://keras.io/api/applications/convnext/#convnexttiny-function) 🕹️
3. [InceptionV3](https://keras.io/api/applications/inceptionv3) 🌀
4. [YOLOv8n](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) 🚀

**Reason for Choosing These Models:**
All mentioned models have approximately close parameters, making them suitable for a comprehensive comparison. I have previous experience working with both pre-trained CNN architectures and YOLOv8 base architectures (tiny and base) for projects like [face-mask-detection](https://github.com/ARPIT2128/SAP-internal-face-mask-detection) and more.

## 📚 Dataset and Models Used

[Dataset](https://github.com/ARPIT2128/DL-Simplified/blob/main/High%20Throughput%20Algae%20Cell%20Detection/Dataset/DATASET.md) description is provided in the project. One of the approaches I recently went through was using [YOLOV5](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marquis03/yolov5-high-throughput-algae-cell-detection) for this dataset (YOLOV5 links to the notebook mentioning the approach).

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhisheks008/DL-Simplified.git
   cd High Throughput Algae Cell Detection

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the Dataset/ directory (create if not exist).

4. Run the notebooks for each model to train and evaluate the performance.
