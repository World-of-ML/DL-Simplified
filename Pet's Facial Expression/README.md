# **Pet's Facial Expression Detection**

### üéØ Goal
This project aims to develop an advanced image classification system that can accurately identify the facial expressions of pets using cutting-edge deep learning techniques.

### Purpose
Understanding pet emotions through their facial expressions can significantly enhance the bond between pets and their owners. This project aims to leverage advanced AI models to detect and classify various facial expressions in pets, aiding in better care and understanding of pets' emotional states.

### üßµ Dataset
The dataset used in this project is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/pets-facial-expression-dataset

### üßæ Description
This project focuses on developing a sophisticated image classification system to identify different facial expressions in pets using deep learning techniques. The system leverages three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: EfficientNet and ResNet50, and Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, each known for their robustness and high performance in image recognition tasks.

### üöÄ Models Implemented
- ViT Transformer: Utilizes the transformer architecture for image classification, providing state-of-the-art accuracy.
- EfficientNet: A family of models that balance model depth, width, and resolution, achieving high performance with fewer parameters.
- ResNet50: Employs residual learning to train very deep networks, addressing the vanishing gradient problem and achieving high accuracy.

### üìö Libraries Needed
- TensorFlow: For building and training deep learning models.
- Keras: For simplifying the creation and training of neural networks.
- NumPy: For numerical computations and array operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.

### üìä Exploratory Data Analysis Results
