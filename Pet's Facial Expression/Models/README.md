# **Pet's Facial Expression Detection**
This project focuses on developing a sophisticated image classification system to identify different facial expressions in pets using deep learning techniques. The system leverages three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: EfficientNet and ResNet50, along with Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, each known for their robustness and high performance in image recognition tasks.


### Models Implemented
- ViT Transformer: Utilizes the transformer architecture for image classification, providing state-of-the-art accuracy.
- EfficientNet: A family of models that balance model depth, width, and resolution, achieving high performance with fewer parameters.
- ResNet50: Employs residual learning to train very deep networks, addressing the vanishing gradient problem and achieving high accuracy.

### Libraries Used
The following libraries were used to implement the models:

- TensorFlow: An open-source library developed by Google for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.
- Keras: A high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations.
- Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for Python and its numerical mathematics extension, NumPy.
