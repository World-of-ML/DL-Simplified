# Air Passengers Dataset

## Overview

The Air Passengers dataset is a classic time series dataset commonly used for analyzing and forecasting air passenger traffic. It contains monthly totals of international airline passengers from January 1949 to December 1960.

## Description

This dataset provides historical data on the number of international airline passengers over a 12-year period. Each data point represents the total number of passengers (in thousands) for a specific month. It is often used to demonstrate time series analysis techniques, such as trend identification, seasonality detection, and forecasting.

## Files

## Columns

The dataset typically consists of two columns:

- `Month`: Date and time stamp indicating the month and year of the observation.
- `Passengers`: The total number of international airline passengers for the corresponding month.

## Usage

The Air Passengers dataset is widely used in the field of time series analysis, forecasting, and machine learning. It serves as a benchmark dataset for evaluating time series forecasting models and techniques. Some common use cases include:

- Analyzing historical trends and seasonality patterns in air passenger traffic.
- Developing forecasting models to predict future passenger demand for airlines and airports.
- Evaluating the impact of external factors such as economic conditions, tourism trends, and airline policies on passenger traffic.
- Comparing the performance of different time series forecasting algorithms and methodologies.
