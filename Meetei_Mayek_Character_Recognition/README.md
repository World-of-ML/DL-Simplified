# Meetei Mayek Character Recogntion

Welcome to the Meetei Mayek Character Recognition repository! This project aims to develop a model for recognizing handwritten characters from the Meetei Mayek script using a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Overview

The repository contains code and resources for training and evaluating a hybrid CNN+LSTM model for Meetei Mayek character recognition. It includes:
- Dataset: Images of Meetei Mayek characters.
- Model: Implementation of the hybrid CNN+LSTM architecture.
- Scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Documentation: README files, code comments, and explanations.

## Workflow

The workflow for using this repository is as follows:

1. **Data Preparation:** Collect and preprocess the dataset of Meetei Mayek handwritten characters.
2. **Model Building:** Design and train the hybrid CNN+LSTM model for character recognition.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using various metrics.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sgvkamalakar/Meetei_Mayek_Character_Recogntion
```
2. Download the dataset
3. Navigate to the model/Hybrid_Model_CNN_LSTM.ipynb
4. Run all the cells
