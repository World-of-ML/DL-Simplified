Sentiment Analysis using BERT and RoBERTa
üéØ Goal
The main goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model that can classify text as positive or negative using deep learning techniques. This project leverages BERT and RoBERTa models to enhance the accuracy and robustness of sentiment classification.

üßæ Description
This project aims to classify text data into binary sentiment labels (positive/negative). It uses pre-trained transformer models (BERT and RoBERTa) for fine-tuning on a custom dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best approach for sentiment analysis.

üßÆ What I Had Done!
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and prepared the text data using NLTK by removing stopwords and non-alphanumeric characters.
Tokenized and encoded the text using BertTokenizer and RobertaTokenizer for model input.
Model Training:

Implemented and fine-tuned a BERT model using bert-base-uncased on the preprocessed data.
Implemented and fine-tuned a RoBERTa model using roberta-base on the same dataset.
Evaluation:

Evaluated both models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
Compared the performance of BERT and RoBERTa to identify the model that performs better on the given dataset.
üöÄ Models Implemented

BERT (bert-base-uncased): Fine-tuned for sentiment classification.

Chosen for its ability to understand complex language structures and context in text data.
RoBERTa (roberta-base): Fine-tuned for sentiment classification.

Chosen for its robustness and improved performance over BERT in certain NLP tasks due to optimized training strategies.

üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/abhisheks008/DL-Simplified.git
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download NLTK data: Run the following in your Python script or interpreter:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
Prepare the dataset: Update the path to your dataset in the code and make sure it has the required columns (text and label).

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python train_and_evaluate.py
The script will train and evaluate the BERT and RoBERTa models and print out the evaluation metrics.
