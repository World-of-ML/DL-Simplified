# SPAM vs HAM Email Classification<br>

## üéØ Goal<br>

The main goal of this project is to develop a robust deep learning model for classifying emails as either spam (SPAM) or legitimate (HAM). Additionally, the project aims to create a Streamlit GUI for a user-friendly interface in real-time email classification.<br>

## üßµ Dataset<br>

The dataset used for this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omokennanna/simple-spam-classification). It consists of two columns: 'text' containing the email content and 'label' indicating whether the email is spam or ham.<br>

## üßæ Description<br>

This project utilizes a deep learning model with an embedding layer, bidirectional LSTM layers, and a dense output layer. The model is trained on the provided dataset to classify emails as spam or ham. A Streamlit GUI is implemented to enable users to perform real-time email classification.<br>

## üßÆ What I had done!<br>

### 1. Data Preparation<br>

- The dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets.<br>
- Missing values are handled, and the text data is preprocessed.<br>

### 2. Model Architecture<br>

- The Machine learning model I used several algorithm for better accuracy.<br>

- The deep learning model comprises an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function.<br>

- The deep learning model comprises an embedding layer, bidirectional LSTM layers, and a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function.<br>

### 3. Training the Model<br>

The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss. The training process is monitored for convergence and effectiveness.<br>

### 4. Streamlit GUI<br>

A Streamlit GUI is implemented for real-time email classification. Users can input an email, and the model predicts whether it is spam or ham.<br>

## üöÄ Models Implemented<br>

1. Machine Learning Model
2. Deep Learning Model with LSTM Layers
3. Deep Learning Model with Bidirectional LSTM Layers

**Why these models:**<br>

1. **Machine Learning Model:**<br>

    This traditional machine learning model serves as a baseline and allows us to compare the performance of deep learning models against a more conventional approach.<br>

2. **Deep Learning Model with LSTM Layers:**<br>

    LSTM layers are particularly effective for sequential data, making them suitable for capturing long-range dependencies and patterns within the input data.<br>

3. **Deep Learning Model with Bidirectional LSTM Layers:**<br>

    Bidirectional LSTM layers enhance the LSTM model by processing sequences in both forward and backward directions, allowing the model to capture information from past and future time steps simultaneously.<br>

## üìö Libraries Needed<br>

1. TensorFlow
2. scikit-learn
3. pandas
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn
6. streamlit

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis Results<br>

### Insight<br>

In the Dataset, we have 88% Ham Data and 12% Spam Data. The distribution of classes is imbalanced, which creates a challenge in accurately classifying emails.<br>
