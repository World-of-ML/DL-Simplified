DESCRIPTION

Sentiment analysis on ChatGPT tweets involves using NLP to analyze emotions and attitudes expressed in tweets by the language model. It categorizes tweets as good, bad, or neutral, providing insights into the overall emotional tone of the content. However, it may not fully capture nuances like humor and sarcasm. Regular updates improve accuracy in understanding human emotions.

WHAT I HAD DONE
