## **Tomato-Leaf Classification using DL**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The objective of this project is to classify images of Tomato leaves into 10 distinct categories based on type and level of illness as well as healthy.

### 🧵 **Dataset**

The dataset consists of two subdirectories: train and val. Both train and val contain 10 subdirectories, each representing a category of leaf images. The train subdirectory contains 1000 images per category, while the val subdirectory contains 100 images per category.

### 🧾 **Description**

The project deals with multi-class classification, classifying images into 10 classes.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

To achieve our goals, the following steps were implemented:

- Images were loaded using keras.utils and normalized to the range 0 to 1.

- Images were resized to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels.

- Custom and pre-trained models were used for this task.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

models used:

- ResNet-50
- Xception
- VGG16
- CNN-Keras
- InceptionV3
- DenseNet-121
- EfficientNetB7

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**
