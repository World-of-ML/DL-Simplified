# Diabetes Predictor - Dataset

The notebooks in this repository analyze a dataset related to diabetes prediction. The dataset contains various health parameters of individuals, such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI (Body Mass Index), insulin level, age, etc. The target variable, 'Outcome', indicates whether an individual has diabetes or not.

## Features
The dataset consists of 768 instances with 8 features. The features include:
1. **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant.
2. **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
3. **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
4. **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
5. **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
6. **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
7. **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).
8. **Age**: Age in years.
   
- The target variable "**Outcome**" indicates whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Class Distribution
- Class 0 (No diabetes): 500 instances
- Class 1 (Diabetes): 268 instances
