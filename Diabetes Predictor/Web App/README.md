# Streamlit Application for Diabetic Prediction

This directory includes a user-friendly Streamlit application designed for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their medical parameters. The application leverages deep learning models trained on diabetic data to provide accurate predictions in real-time.

## üìù Features

- **Input Medical Parameters**: Users can input various medical parameters, including glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., into the application.
- **Real-time Prediction**: The application utilizes trained artificial neural network (ANN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and recurrent neural network (RNN) models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the input parameters.
- **Intuitive Interface**: The Streamlit application is designed with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it accessible to users from diverse backgrounds.
- **Immediate Results**: Users receive instant predictions on the likelihood of diabetes upon submitting their medical parameters.
- **Accessibility**: The application aims to promote accessibility and ease of use, allowing individuals to easily assess their risk of diabetes and take proactive measures for their health.
