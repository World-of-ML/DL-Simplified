## **AI Generated vs Real Images Classification using DL**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The objective of this project is to classify images, on whether they were AI generated or real images with human background like paintings and pictures.

### 🧵 **Dataset**

The dataset consists of 2 subfolders each with a subdirectory leading to the images. Images have been reshaped to 224X224 pixels for modelling.

### 🧾 **Description**

The project deals with binary classification, classifying images into the two classes: AIArt or RealArt.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

To achieve our goals, following were implemented:

- Images were loaded using keras.utils and normalized into the range (0 to 1).

- Images have been set to a fixed size of 224X224 pixels.

- Custom as well as pre-trained models were used for this task.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

models used:

- ResNet-50
- Xception
- VGG16
- CNN-Keras
- Inception

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**

- Keras

- Tensorflow

- Numpy

- Matplotlib
