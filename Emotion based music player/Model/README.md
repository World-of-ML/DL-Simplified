Project Title: Emotion-Based Music
🎯 Goal
---The main goal of this project is to create a web application that recommends music based on the user's emotions. This is achieved by using a model that classifies different emotions.

🧵 Dataset
---The dataset used in this project are emotion.npy and label.npy which are typically used to store NumPy arrays, which may contain data such as numerical values, model weights, or feature sets, possibly for your emotion-based music player project..

🧾 Description
---This project utilizes MediaPipe, Keras, OpenCV, and Streamlit to build a web application. The application captures webcam input to detect emotions and recommend music accordingly. The project is explained in detail in a video linked in the README.

🧮 What I Had Done!
---Developed a model to classify emotions using a live emoji project code.
---Created a web application using Streamlit and Streamlit-webrtc for webcam capture.
---Integrated the emotion classification model into the web application for music recommendation.

🚀 Models Implemented
1. Pretrained Deep Learning Model (model.h5):

-->Likely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for emotion recognition, especially in processing facial and hand landmarks for detecting user emotions.
-->The model is loaded using Keras' load_model function, indicating it's a neural network trained on emotion-labeled data.<br>
2. Mediapipe's Holistic and Hands Models:

-->Mediapipe Holistic: Used for detecting key facial and body landmarks.
-->Mediapipe Hands: Used for detecting hand landmarks to infer gestures that may also be used for emotion recognition.

📚 Libraries Needed
MediaPipe
Keras
OpenCV
Streamlit
Streamlit-webrtc

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Results
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved examining the distribution of the dataset, visualizing sample images, and understanding the different classes of facial expressions. The dataset are set to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

📈 Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores
---Final Accuracy = 58.33%, Validation Accuracy = 54.99%

📢 Conclusion
---The emotion-based music player successfully integrates deep learning and computer vision techniques to create a personalized, emotion-driven music experience. By leveraging facial expression and hand gesture recognition through Mediapipe, combined with a pretrained deep learning model, the system can detect the user's emotional state in real-time. This allows for dynamic music recommendations that adapt to the user's mood, enhancing the listening experience.

The project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can transform user interaction with media, making it more intuitive, personalized, and engaging. With future improvements, such as more advanced emotion recognition and enhanced music recommendations, this system could revolutionize how users interact with digital content, making it more emotionally responsive and contextually aware.
