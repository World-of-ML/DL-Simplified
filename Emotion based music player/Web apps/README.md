<h2>Emotion Based Music Player</h2>
Goal 🎯
---The main goal of this project is to create a web application that recommends music based on the user's emotions. This is achieved by using a model that classifies different emotions.

Model(s) used for the Web App 🧮
1. Pretrained Deep Learning Model (model.h5):

-->Likely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for emotion recognition, especially in processing facial and hand landmarks for detecting user emotions.
-->The model is loaded using Keras' load_model function, indicating it's a neural network trained on emotion-labeled data.<br>
2. Mediapipe's Holistic and Hands Models:

-->Mediapipe Holistic: Used for detecting key facial and body landmarks.
-->Mediapipe Hands: Used for detecting hand landmarks to infer gestures that may also be used for emotion recognition
