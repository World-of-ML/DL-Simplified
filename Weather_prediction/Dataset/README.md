# Weather Prediction Datasets

This repository contains datasets used for weather prediction analysis. The datasets are sourced from Kaggle and are described below.

## Datasets

### 1. [Weather Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/weather-prediction/data?select=weather_prediction_dataset.csv)

This dataset contains historical weather data with various meteorological parameters. Key features include:
- **Temperature**: Recorded in degrees Celsius.
- **Humidity**: Measured in percentage.
- **Wind Speed**: Measured in meters per second.
- **Precipitation**: Recorded in millimeters.
- **Other Parameters**: Additional meteorological data relevant for weather prediction.

### 2. [Weather Prediction BBQ Labels](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/weather-prediction/data?select=weather_prediction_bbq_labels.csv)

This dataset provides labels indicating whether the weather conditions are suitable for a BBQ. It includes:
- **Date**: Corresponding to the weather data.
- **BBQ Label**: Binary label (0 or 1) indicating if the weather is BBQ-friendly.

## Usage

These datasets can be used for various weather prediction tasks, including regression analysis to predict specific weather parameters and classification tasks to determine BBQ-friendly conditions.
