### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

## Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
1. **Model Setup**:
   - The ANN consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer.
   - The input layer has neurons equal to the number of features in the dataset.
   - Two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions are included to introduce non-linearity.
   - Dropout layers with a dropout rate of 0.2 are added after each hidden layer to prevent overfitting.
   - The output layer has a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

2. **Compilation**:
   - The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss function, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.

3. **Training**:
   - The model is trained over 100 epochs with early stopping implemented to prevent overfitting.
   - Early stopping monitors the validation loss and stops training if it does not improve for 5 consecutive epochs, restoring the best weights.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - After training, the model is evaluated using the test data to calculate the test loss and accuracy.

 `ANN is suitable for this project because it can handle complex relationships between weather variables and BBQ suitability. It's capable of learning from large datasets and can capture non-linear patterns effectively.`

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
1. **Model Setup**:
   - The CNN includes a reshaping layer, a 1D convolutional layer with 10 filters and a kernel size of 2, followed by a flattening layer.
   - A dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 is added after flattening to prevent overfitting.
   - Finally, an output dense layer with a sigmoid activation function is included for binary classification.

2. **Compilation**:
   - Similar to ANN, the CNN is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss function, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.

3. **Training**:
   - The model is trained over a specified number of epochs with the given training data.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - After training, the model's performance is evaluated using test data to calculate the test loss and accuracy.

`CNN is suitable for this project because it can extract spatial and temporal patterns from weather data, similar to how it extracts features from images. By leveraging 1D convolutional layers, CNNs can capture sequential dependencies in time-series data, making them suitable for weather prediction tasks.`
## Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM):
1. **Model Setup**:
   - The model includes a ConvLSTM2D layer with 64 filters, a kernel size of (1, 1), and ReLU activation function.
   - A flattening layer is added after ConvLSTM for reshaping the output.
   - Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 is included to prevent overfitting.
   - An output dense layer with a sigmoid activation function is added for binary classification.

2. **Compilation**:
   - Similar to ANN and CNN, the model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss function, Adam optimizer, and accuracy metric.

3. **Training**:
   - The model is trained with early stopping callback to prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - After training, the model's performance is evaluated using test data, and the accuracy is calculated.

`ConvLSTM is suitable for this project because it combines the strengths of CNNs and LSTMs. It can effectively capture spatial patterns in weather data while retaining the ability to model long-term dependencies over time. This makes it well-suited for predicting BBQ weather conditions based on sequential weather measurements.`

### 📢 **Conclusion**

The conclusion of this project is that we've successfully built and evaluated three different models for predicting BBQ weather conditions based on various weather variables.

`Additionally, the accuracy of the model varies depending on the city selected. While this notebook uses Heathrow as an example, users can input different cities, leading to potentially different accuracy results.`

- We utilized an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Convolutional LSTM model to predict whether weather conditions are suitable for outdoor BBQ activities.
- Each model was trained and evaluated using appropriate techniques such as dropout regularization and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- The models were compared based on their accuracy scores to determine the best-fitted model for the specific project.

Here are the accuracy scores obtained for each model:
- ANN Accuracy: [93%]
- CNN Accuracy: [94%]
- ConvLSTM Accuracy: [96%]

Based on these accuracy scores, we can determine the best-fitted model among all the developed models for this particular project. We'll choose the model with the highest accuracy score as it indicates better performance in predicting BBQ weather conditions.
