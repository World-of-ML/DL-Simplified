# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models. Below is a brief description of each model:

## üñºÔ∏è LeNet5_Model
LeNet-5 is a convolutional neural network designed for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition. It was one of the earliest CNNs and has a simple, efficient architecture.

### Key Features:
- 2 convolutional layers
- 2 subsampling (pooling) layers
- 2 fully connected layers
- Output layer with softmax activation

## üì± MobileNet_Model
MobileNet is a lightweight neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters.

### Key Features:
- Depthwise separable convolutions
- Efficient architecture for mobile devices
- Trade-off between latency and accuracy using width multiplier and resolution multiplier

## üîç ResNet50_Model
ResNet50 is a deep residual network with 50 layers. It introduces skip connections (or residual connections) to solve the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for training of very deep networks.

### Key Features:
- 50 layers deep
- Residual connections
- Excellent accuracy on various benchmarks

## üñºÔ∏è Simple_CNN_Model
A Simple CNN model is a basic convolutional neural network for image classification. It consists of a few convolutional layers followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers.

### Key Features:
- Easy to understand and implement
- Suitable for educational purposes and small datasets
- Customizable architecture

## VGG16_Model
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network that achieved great success in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2014. It uses a very deep architecture with small 3x3 convolutions.

### Key Features:
- 16 layers deep
- Small receptive fields (3x3 convolutions)
- Pre-trained on ImageNet
