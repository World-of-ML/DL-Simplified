## **Eye Disease Classification using DL**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The objective of this project is to classify images of eyes into 4 categories: Normal, Cataract, Glaucoma, and Diabetic Retinopathy.

### 🧵 **Dataset**

The dataset consists of 4 subdirectories under the dataset, each having approximately 1050 images totalling to 4217.

### 🧾 **Description**

The project deals with multiclass classification, classifying images into 4 categories: Normal, Cataract, Glaucoma, and Diabetic Retinopathy.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

To achieve our goals, the following steps were implemented:

- Images were loaded using keras.utils and normalized to the range 0 to 1.

- Turned Labels into probability distributions.

- Images were resized to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels.

- Custom and pre-trained models were used for this task.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

models used:

- ResNet-50
- Xception
- VGG16
- CNN
- InceptionV3
- DenseNet-121
- MobileNet

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**
