# Snake Breed Classification with TensorFlow

## Overview

This project demonstrates the classification of snake breeds using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model built with TensorFlow's Sequential API. It incorporates libraries like pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
## Installation

Install required libraries:

`pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib`

## Usage

Clone or download this repository.
Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format with appropriate features and labels.
Modify the code in snake_breed_classification.py to specify:
1. File path to your dataset
2. Number of snake breeds
3. Any necessary preprocessing steps
4. Run the Python script:

`python snake_breed_classification.py`

## Project Structure

snake_breed_classification.py: Contains the Python code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
