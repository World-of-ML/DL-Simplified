# Artwork Image Recognition Webapp

## Goal üéØ

The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application tailored for the seamless recognition of diverse artworks through advanced deep learning models.

## Model Used for the Web App üßÆ

The web application utilizes a deep learning model trained for Artwork Image Classification. The model architecture includes the ResNet 152V2 pretrained model which is trained on the dataset of various artworks.

## Features of the Web App üåê

- **Upload Artwork Image Recognition**: Allows users to upload various Artworks.
- **Prediction Display**: Provides predictions for type of Artworks based on the uploaded Artwork images.
- **Description about the artwork**: Provides Description about the artwork which has been predicted using Gemini AI. 

**Note:** Ensure to update the paths accordingly based on your local machine's directory structure.

**Data and Model File Download:**

- Due to the large size of the dataset, it is not included in the GitHub repository. Please download the dataset from the provided location. 

- Similarly, the trained model file ('model.h5') is generated when you run the notebook successfully. Please keep this file in a directory named 'Web App' for smooth deployment without hiccups.

**Ensure to update the paths accordingly based on your local machine's directory structure**
