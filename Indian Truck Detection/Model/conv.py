# A Python script to change the size of images and save them inside a new directory
# The script contains two functions:
# 1. To  change the names of current images to standard number labels.
# 2. To convert the images of random sizes to a fixed size 200X200 resolution.
# This makes the further process of training the model easy as dimensions of each image
# are the same


# Import all the necessary modules
import cv2
import glob
import os


# Source folder location of images
sourceFolder = "D://ML DL AI DSBDA//Indian Trucks Detection//Truck Images"

# Create a separate directory to store processed images
os.mkdir('Processed Images')

        new_file_name = '{}.jpg'.format(k)
        os.rename(old_file_name, new_file_name)
        k += 1
