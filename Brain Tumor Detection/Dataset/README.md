## 📝 Abstract

A brain tumor is a formidable disease affecting both children and adults, constituting 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors. Annually, around 11,700 people receive a brain tumor diagnosis, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 34 percent for men and 36 percent for women. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics are crucial to improving patient life expectancy.

The dataset focuses on automated classification techniques using Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically employing Deep Learning Algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Transfer Learning (TL). These techniques offer higher accuracy than manual classification, aiding doctors worldwide in efficient detection and classification.

## 🌐 Context

Brain tumors present complexities in size and location, requiring expertise for accurate analysis. Developing countries often face challenges due to a shortage of skilled doctors and insufficient knowledge about tumors. An automated system on the cloud can address these issues, providing a faster and more accessible solution.

## 🔍 Definition

To detect and classify brain tumors using CNN and TL, leveraging Deep Learning as an asset, and examining tumor positions through segmentation.

## ℹ️ About the Data

The dataset comprises three folders:
- **Yes:** Contains 1500 Brain MRI Images with tumorous conditions.
- **No:** Consists of 1500 Brain MRI Images without tumors.
- **Pred:** Includes an additional 60 images for prediction.
