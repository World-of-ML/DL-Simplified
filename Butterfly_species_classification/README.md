# Hindi Letter Classification

## Introduction

Butterfly diversity is essential for ecosystem health and stability. However, manual classification of butterfly species can be time-consuming and prone to errors. An automated system using deep learning can expedite this process, providing a valuable tool for researchers, conservationists, and butterfly enthusiasts.

## Web Application

Butterfly species classification is a challenging task due to the diverse appearances and intricate patterns of butterflies. Accurate classification aids in biodiversity studies, conservation efforts, and ecological research. This project proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach utilizing the LeNet-5 architecture for automated butterfly species classification. The model demonstrates promising accuracy in distinguishing among 100 different butterfly species, facilitating researchers and enthusiasts in identifying and studying butterflies.
