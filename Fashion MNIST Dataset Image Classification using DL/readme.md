## **Fashion MNIST Dataset Image Classification using DL**

### 🎯 **Goal**
This project focuses on implementing an image classification system utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically with Keras—a high-level neural networks API, and the Fashion MNIST dataset. The primary goal is to train a model capable of accurately recognizing pictures of clothing items from grayscale images.

### 🧵 **Dataset**
Data source: [Fashion MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)

### 🧾 **Description**
This project aims to classify images of clothing items into 10 categories (e.g., T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, etc.) using deep learning techniques. The purpose is to demonstrate the application of CNNs in image classification tasks.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**
- Loaded and preprocessed the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Implemented a CNN model using Keras.
- Trained and evaluated the CNN model.
- Analyzed the performance of the model.
- Designed a web app for the same.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**
The following techniques and algorithms were implemented in this project:
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data.
- Data Augmentation: Augmenting the training data with techniques such as rotation, width and height shifts, and horizontal flipping helps improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.
- Early Stopping: Early stopping is a regularization technique used during training to monitor the validation loss and stop training if it doesn't improve for a certain number of epochs, thus preventing overfitting.

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**
The following libraries are required to run this project:
 * numpy
 * tensorflow
 * keras
 * matplotlib

### 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis Results**

`INCLUSION OF IMAGES OF THE VISUALIZATION IS MUST (RESULT OF EDA).`

### 📈 **Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores**
The performance of the CNN model based on accuracy score is as follows:
- CNN: 0.895

### 📢 **Conclusion**
In conclusion, the CNN model achieved an accuracy score of 0.895 on the Fashion MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks.
