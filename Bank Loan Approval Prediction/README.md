This Project is aimed to make you familiar with popular Deep Learning Techniques. From Data processing, Data Visualization, Modeling to Model Enhancement everything is covered in this project repository.

The project repository have 3 implemented (ipynb) notebooks:
  1. The `bank-loan-approval-using-AI.ipynb` notebook uses `UniversalBank.csv ` dataset and a simple multi-layer neural network model.
  2. The `loan_approval_prediction_DL.ipynb` notebok uses `loan_approval_dataset.csv` dataset and contains 8 models. In this notebook lots of experiments have been executed and also important techniques for model Enhancement via Hyperparameter tuning have been performed. There are 2 such experiments for Hyperparameter tuning. The models (7&8) are the best models obtained from hyperparameter tuning. Since ML/DL is all about `Experiment, Experiment, Experiment` in this notebook you'll learn how to save time between experiments and how you can automate your experiments.
  3. The `FNN_TabNet_WDNN.ipynb` notebook uses `UniversalBank.csv` dataset and have more sophisticated and complex model. In this notebbok you'll learn how to build such complex models and improve the performance of your model and try to get the best possible result from your model.



In a nutshell this project repository contains a lot of information and techniques that will enhance your existing knowledge of deep learning. And Everything is covered in a beginner friendly way making it easier to learn and understand.

The structure of project repository is as follows:
 - Dataset: contains the datasets used in this project.
 - Images: contains the visualization images and training curves of models.
 - Model: contains the implemented code notebooks.
 - Web App: contains the web implementation of the project.
 - requirements.txt have all the required libraries for implementation of this project.
