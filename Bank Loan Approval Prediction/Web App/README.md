## Web Application for Bank Loan Approval Prediction using Flask

### Goal üéØ
The main goal is to develop a user-friendly web application that predicts whether the customer's bank loan will be approved or rejected using deep learning models. This application will allow users to enter necessary details and receive predictions.

### Model used for the Web App üßÆ
The backend of this web application utilizes Tabular Neural Network for Bank Loan Approval prediction. It has been trained on [Universal Bank Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new) that contains around 5000 data.

Deep Learning models which are considered for training:

* Feedforward Neural Network
* Feedforward Neural Network with k-Fold validation
* TabNet model with k-Fold validation
* Wide & Deep neural network architecture

Amongst this, **TabNet model** is selected which gives 0.985 validation accuracy.
