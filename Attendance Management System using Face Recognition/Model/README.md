Face Recognition in Deep Learning

In this Project used models - 
1) DeepFace
2) FaceNet
3) VGGNet
4) FaceRecognition Library

FaceRecognition library gives us higher Accuracy because no need of any models.
Then Facenet and DeepFace almost gives similar Accuracy.
VGGNet gives low Accuracy.

Install following Packages -
Numpy
Keras
deepface
PIL
tkinter
cv2
os
tensorflow
mtcnn

install the following and store in same working folder
1) dlib-19.24.1-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
2) facenet_keras.h5
3) vgg_face_weights.h5


Create two folders namely imagesatted and imagebasics

Store some images in imagesatted for recognition and dataset purpose.

Create Attendence.csv file

Create the following python files.and also while running each separate file change their names into gui2.py and GUI.py.
for ex. if you want to run DeepFace.py file then instead of AttendenceProject.py file change its name to DeepFace.py file into gui2.py file and GUI.py


Run gui2.py file and done you can recognize image.
